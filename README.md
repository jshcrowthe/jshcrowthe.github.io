#jshcrowthe.github.io

My Github Pages site, one day this will be where I feature my Github projects and all of the cool stuff that I'm doing. 

Until I actually get around to doing that this redirects to my blog as well as setting up redirects for the following URL's:

- https://jshcrowthe.github.io/hacking-http
- https://jshcrowthe.github.io/polymer-angularjs
- https://jshcrowthe.github.io/howto-polymer-webcomponents

I have pointed these at the proper slides.com URL's for these presentations and deleted the corresponding repositories.
